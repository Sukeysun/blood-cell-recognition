# blood-cell-recognition
project for 523
I didn't add the TRAIN and TEST floder to this repo as they are pretty large.
In version 2.0 I added: 
  * preparing jobs
  * part I -- processing data
  * part II -- get data:
    * X is the input grayscale images 
    * y is the encoded labels (hot vectors (ex : 2 -> [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])) 5 classes 4+1
    * z is also encoded lables
